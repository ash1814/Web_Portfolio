             <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science graduate with a minor in Marketing from Independent University,
Bangladesh.As a student, I had been extensively involved in my university communities
and club. I served for the “Jukti Club” of Independent University, Bangladesh which had
allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills. I have significant experience in organizing
various events, including fundraisers, cultural events, and sporting events, where I had to
work closely with my peers and the administration. These experiences have allowed me to
develop strong time management and organizational skills. I have experience in working in
an agile environment facing new challenges every day having experience in carrying out
tasks that do not just include engineering. I have worked with cross-functional teams to carry
out business plans and executions and other tasks assigned by my supervisor. These tasks
have significantly improved my communication skills and problem-solving skills.
